## Handlers
The handlers directory contains Ansible handlers. Handlers are special tasks that are defined to respond to events triggered by other tasks. These events are typically notified by tasks throughout the role. When a handler is notified, it runs a specific task to handle the event. For example, you might use a handler to restart a service after a configuration file is updated. Handlers are defined in YAML files within the handlers directory, and they are referenced in tasks using the notify keyword.

## Tasks
The tasks directory contains YAML files that define the core tasks and operations to be performed by the role. Each file typically represents a specific task or group of tasks. These tasks can include tasks to install packages, configure services, copy files, manage users, and perform various other automation activities.

## Templates
The templates directory is where you store templates for configuration files. Ansible can use these templates to generate configuration files on target machines dynamically. Templates allow you to include variables and conditionals in your configuration files, making them more adaptable to different environments. Ansible's template module, often used in conjunction with Jinja2 templating, helps render these templates.

## Defaults
The defaults directory contains default variable values for the role. These variables can be overridden by users or other roles when including or importing the role. This directory is particularly useful for defining role-specific configuration settings. By organizing defaults in this directory, users can easily customize the behavior of the role without modifying the role itself.
